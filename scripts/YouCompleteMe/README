[Intro]
YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for Vim. It has several completion engines:

an identifier-based engine that works with every programming language,
a Clang-based engine that provides native semantic code completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ (from now on referred to as "the C-family languages"),
a Jedi-based completion engine for Python 2 and 3 (using the JediHTTP wrapper),
an OmniSharp-based completion engine for C#,
a combination of Gocode and Godef semantic engines for Go,
a TSServer-based completion engine for TypeScript,
a Tern-based completion engine for JavaScript,
a racer-based completion engine for Rust,
and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).

[General installation steps]
1. Ensure that your version of Vim is at least 7.3.598 and that it has support for Python 2 or Python 3 scripting.
    :version
    :echo has('python') || has('python3')

2. Install YCM with Vundle. This would mean adding a Plugin 'Valloric/YouCompleteMe' line to your vimrc.

3. Download the latest version of libclang. We recommend using the official binaries from (http://llvm.org/releases/download.html) if at all possible. Make sure you download the correct archive file for your OS.

4. Compile the ycm_core library that YCM needs. This library is the C++ engine that YCM uses to get fast completions. (CMAKE needed)

5. Set up support for additional languages, as desired:
    * C# support: install Mono on non-Windows platforms. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/OmniSharpServer and run msbuild (Windows) or xbuild (other platforms, using Mono) depending on your platform. On Windows, be sure that the build utility msbuild is in your PATH.
    Go support: install Go and add it to your path. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/gocode and run go build.
    TypeScript support: as with the quick installation, simply npm install -g typescript after successfully installing Node.js and npm.
    JavaScript support: install Node.js and npm. Then navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/tern_runtime and run npm install --production
    Rust support: install Rust. Navigate to YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/third_party/racerd and run cargo build --release.

[User Guide]
C-family Semantic Completion
YCM looks for a .ycm_extra_conf.py file in the directory of the opened file or in any directory above it in the hierarchy (recursively); when the file is found, it is loaded (only once!) as a Python module.  

See YCM's own .ycm_extra_conf.py for details on how this works. Your project needs different flags. Hint: just replace the strings in the flags variable with compilation flags necessary for your project. That should be enough for 99% of projects.
